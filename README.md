**** ABOUT PROJECT****
The interactive quiz application is a fun and educational project built using frontend web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to create a simple and user-friendly platform where users can answer questions and test their knowledge on different topics. The quiz app can be used by students, teachers, or anyone who wants to learn new things in an enjoyable way.

The main goal of this project is to create a webpage where questions are shown one by one, and users can select their answers by clicking on options. After answering all questions, the app shows the score, correct answers, and sometimes feedback. This makes learning interactive and engaging.

Features of the Quiz Application
Simple and clean design: The quiz app has a neat layout using HTML and CSS. The questions are displayed at the top of the page, followed by multiple-choice options in button style. The buttons change color to show if the selected answer is right or wrong. CSS is used to style the buttons, add background colors, set fonts, and make the app look attractive.

Question navigation: JavaScript is used to control how the questions appear. After selecting an answer, the user can move to the next question by clicking a “Next” button. The app can keep track of which question is currently displayed.

Score tracking: The app calculates the score as the user selects answers. Each correct answer increases the score. At the end of the quiz, the total score is displayed, letting the user know how well they performed.

Responsive design: The quiz app can be made responsive using CSS so that it works well on mobile phones, tablets, and computers. This means users can play the quiz on any device without any problem.

Instant feedback: The app can provide feedback after each question or at the end of the quiz. For example, it can highlight the correct answer or show a message like “Good job!” or “Try again.”

Timer (optional): We can also add a timer for each question using JavaScript. This makes the quiz more exciting because users have limited time to choose their answers.

Technologies Used
HTML: To build the structure of the quiz (question area, buttons, score section).

CSS: To style the quiz and make it look visually appealing.

JavaScript: To handle the logic, like showing questions, checking answers, calculating score, and showing results.

Purpose of the Project
This project helps in learning the basics of web development. It teaches how to create interactive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also improves problem-solving skills because you need to write code that checks answers and updates the score.
